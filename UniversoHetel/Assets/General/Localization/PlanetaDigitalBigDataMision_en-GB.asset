    m_Localized: Data in the digital world, such as Big Data and the Internet of
      Things (IoT), helps us understand and improve the world. Data is collected
      from many different sources, such as devices, applications and social networks,
      to transform it into useful information. Additionally, through artificial intelligence,
      cloud processing power, and advanced analytics, including Business Intelligence
      (BI), we can analyze this data more quickly and efficiently. This allows us
      to discover hidden patterns, predict future trends and make informed decisions
      both in business and beyond, to improve people's lives and enable everything
      to run better.
